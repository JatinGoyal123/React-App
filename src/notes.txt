react hooks must be called in the component function 
not outside that
not inside any nested function 
use keyword se start hoti hai hooks most important hook hai hamari useState
and jitne bhi functions hai vo hamare on se start hote hai
// useState returns an array where the first value is the value itself and the second value is the updating function.
we can use array destructuring to store this.
ex: 
const [title,setTitle]=useState(props.title);
